My difficulties: In the "Recent Logins" column, I haven't placed the "x" in the gray area, "9" in the red area and "+" in the blue area where they're supposed to be.

"samplePicture.png" is what I'm trying to recreate.
Anyone interested should lemme know when it's recreated perfectly (at least 98%).
Thanks!
